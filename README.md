# Unbounded
Welcome to the Unbounded repository! Unbounded is a 2D tile dungeon crawler that generates its levels procedurally. 
The game is built in Java, and it is inspired by classic games like Rogue and Dwarf Fortress.

## Procedural Generation
One of the key features of Unbounded is its procedural generation. The game employs several different algorithms to generate its levels, 
including my own custom algorithm for creating dungeons. The algorithm works by attempting to place randomly sized rooms on a map a set 
number of times and then connecting them together. This process results in unique and challenging dungeon layouts for players to explore.

Outside levels in Unbounded are generated using Perlin noise, which allows for the smooth transition between different types of terrain. 
This feature adds a layer of realism to the game and creates a more immersive experience for players.

Caves in Unbounded are generated using cellular automata. This process creates cave systems that are interconnected, 
with multiple paths and areas to explore. The result is a dynamic and ever-changing game world that keeps players engaged and on their toes.

## Inspiration
The Unbounded project was born out of my desire to challenge myself and create a game that they would enjoy playing. 
By choosing to build the game in Java without any pre-made game engine, I'm able to push my skills to the limit and create a unique gaming 
experience that stands out from the crowd.
